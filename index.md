## Building large-scale AI agents and ML solutions at BMW Group

This page provides deeper technical context on selected AI, GenAI, and cloud projects I’ve led and contributed to.

## About me

I am an engineering leader driving cloud platforms and large-scale AI/GenAI and ML systems. I have over two decades of industry experience, including more than a decade leading cross-functional teams on high-impact AI, cloud, and strategic initiatives. At **BMW Group**, the machine learning teams I built and led developed features and models interacting with **millions of vehicles**.

My career has evolved from writing **real-time embedded C++** for Superbike racing teams to architecting **enterprise-scale Generative AI** solutions. Currently, I lead teams building **LLM-based agents** at the BMW Group, using GenAI to optimize developer productivity and the Connected Vehicle backend serving **23M vehicles**. I combine hands-on system design with end-to-end technical ownership.

I also enjoy teaching a Master’s course in **Analytics and AI** for economics students at <a href="https://www.hs-fresenius.com/location/munich/">Fresenius University Munich</a>.

## 🛠 Selected Projects

<a id="structural-testing-for-llm-based-agents"></a>
### Structural testing for LLM-based agents
**2025** | Publication: [**IEEE Paper**](assets/docs/2025%20Automated%20structural%20testing%20of%20LLM-based-agents.pdf), Source code: [**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit)

> Framework enabling unit- and integration-level testing of LLM-based agents beyond acceptance tests. Combining OpenTelemetry-based tracing with automated verification and mocking of agent components (including LLM) to enable software engineering best practices (TDD, Regression testing) for GenAI. **I ideated the overall approach and contributed to the core implementation.**

<a id="generative-ai-toolkit"></a>
### Generative AI toolkit
**2024** | Publication: [**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14215), Source code: [**GitHub Repo**](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit)

> Open-source framework that automates core workflows across the lifecycle of LLM-based applications—configuration, testing, monitoring, and optimization. **I ideated and co-designed the toolkit and served as technical owner for its development.**

<a id="generative-ai-based-cloud-assistant"></a>
### Cloud Optimization Bot
**2023** | Publication: [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/bmw-group-develops-a-genai-assistant-to-accelerate-infrastructure-optimization-on-aws/), Video: [**AWS re:invent Innovation talk 2023**](https://youtu.be/1Lat8dP7Eq0?si=V6DHfae2EGjnYsGt&t=2458), additional reach: [**Facebook (~2 M views)**](https://www.facebook.com/amazonwebservices/videos/1126783061768882)

> One of the earliest LLM-based multi-agent systems. Built on Amazon Bedrock to optimize cloud infrastructure delivering eight-digit annual operational savings. **I ideated and co-designed the system and served as the Technical Owner leading the development.**

<a id="scaling-cloud-governance"></a>
### Scaling end-to-end cloud governance
**2023** | Publication: [**AWS Blog**](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/mt/how-bmw-group-uses-automation-to-achieve-end-to-end-compliance-at-scale-on-aws/), Video: [**AWS re:invent 2023**](https://youtu.be/nu69JLkc0G8?si=J4G4mUOVnV7qVtGq&t=2332)

> Automated compliance framework enforcing internal standards across hundreds of AWS accounts at scale. **I ideated the framework, co-led the project, and contributed directly to the development.**

### Proactive Care
**2022** | Video: [**AWS re:invent 2022**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2kk-4Jskk&t=250s)

> Led a cross-functional prototyping team delivering an end-to-end automotive diagnosis workflow at scale (1M vehicles). Later rolled out fleet-wide to 23M vehicles by BMW aftersales organization.
